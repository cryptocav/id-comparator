Unique ID Comparator
====================

This script allows you to compare two JSON files to identify changes in unique IDs. It reports the total count of unique IDs for each file, as well as lists any IDs that have been added or removed. Additionally, the script issues warnings if there are signs of ID switching, where the total count remains the same but some IDs have been removed.

Features
--------

-   Load Unique IDs: The script loads unique IDs from JSON files and identifies duplicates.
-   Compare IDs: It compares the unique IDs from two JSON files to find added and removed IDs.
-   Report Changes: The script reports counts of unique IDs and lists added and removed IDs.
-   Detect ID Switching: It warns if the total count stays the same while IDs have been removed, indicating potential ID switching.

Prerequisites
-------------

To run this script, you need:

-   Python 3 or later
-   JSON files with an `id` key

Usage
-----

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal, providing the paths to the original and updated JSON files:

bash

Copy code

`python3 compareids.py original.json updated.json`

Replace `original.json` with the path to your original JSON file and `updated.json` with the path to the updated JSON file.

Output
------

When you run the script, it displays:

-   The number of unique IDs in each JSON file.
-   A list of added IDs, if any.
-   A list of removed IDs, if any.
-   A warning message if the total count stays the same while some IDs have been removed.

Example Output
--------------

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

text

Copy code

`Number of unique IDs in 'original.json': 5534
Number of unique IDs in 'updated.json': 5555

IDs removed:
None

IDs added:
['abc123', 'def456', 'ghi789']

No IDs were removed.

Warning: Total count remains the same, but IDs have been removed. This could indicate ID switching.`

In this example, the script finds no removed IDs but lists a set of added IDs. It also issues a warning if ID switching is suspected.

Error Handling
--------------

If there's an error loading the JSON files, the script outputs an error message and exits. This can happen due to:

-   File not found
-   JSON decoding errors
