# id-comparator
This script allows you to compare two JSON files to identify changes in unique IDs. It reports the total count of unique IDs for each file, as well as lists any IDs that have been added or removed. Additionally, the script issues warnings if there are signs of ID switching, where the total count remains the same but some IDs have been removed.
